Architecture Overview
This document provides a high-level overview of the analytical platform architecture.

It outlines how data pipelines, transformation units, statistical modules (DBF-style), and Y/Z metric construction interact across different layers.

Core Principles
Modularity and clear separation of responsibilities
Extensibility for advanced statistical modeling
Reproducible analytics using Python, Pandas, and Numpy
Compatibility with SAI-based metric extraction workflows
Next Steps
Add system diagrams
Define analytics layer specifications
Introduce notebook structure for prototypes
