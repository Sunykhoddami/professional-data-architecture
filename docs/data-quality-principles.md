Data Quality Principles
This document outlines the core principles used to ensure data integrity across all analytical layers.

1. Accuracy
All datasets must represent the real-world values with minimal deviation.

2. Consistency
Data schemas and field formats must remain consistent across pipelines.

3. Completeness
Missing values must be identified, categorized, and resolved during the transformation stage.

4. Traceability
Each transformation step must be reproducible and documented.

5. Validation Rules (Upcoming)
Column-level constraints
Statistical sanity checks (Pandas & Numpy)
Outlier detection heuristics
