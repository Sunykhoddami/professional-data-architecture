Professional Data Architecture
A structured, scalable, and modular blueprint for designing analytical systems with a focus on high‑performance data pipelines, statistical modeling, and network‑level metrics (Y/Z) extraction.

Vision
This repository outlines the core architectural decisions, standards, and modular breakdown for a multi‑stage analytical platform using Python, SAI-based telemetry, and DBF-style statistical modeling.

Core Components
Data Acquisition Layer (SAI-based metrics extraction)
Transformation & Validation (Python, Pandas, Numpy)
Statistical Units (DBF-style models, non‑ML)
Analytics Layer (Y and Z feature construction)
Reporting & Documentation
Roadmap
Phase 1: Define architecture
Phase 2: Add design documents
Phase 3: Integrate notebooks
Phase 4: Implement prototypes
Status
Initial architecture planning in progress.
